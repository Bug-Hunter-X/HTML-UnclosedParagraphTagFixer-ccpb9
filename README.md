# Unclosed Paragraph Tag Bug

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an unclosed paragraph tag (`<p>`).  Unclosed tags can lead to unexpected rendering and layout problems in web browsers.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected version.

This is a simple example to highlight the importance of properly closing HTML tags.
